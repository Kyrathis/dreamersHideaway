                <p>You have arrived at the homepage for Dreamer's Hideaway. A short, or perhaps long, trip through the interests and actions of Kyra. Throughout this site you'll see multiple blog posts, pictures of crafts, notes on coffee experimentation, and a multitude of other delightful content.</p>

            <div class="contentBox">
                <p>This website is curated by Kyra Young, a Software Engineering student currently enrolled at Mid-State Technical College. Here at Mid-State she has studied a couple of coding and scripting languages, and the theories and practices behind them. In the near future she hopes to 
                    acquire an internship at one of the local companies in her city so she can continue her passion of developing software.

                <p>
                    Outside of class Kyra has multiple interests and hobbies. She has recently taken an interest in learning about coffee. She has been studying how and where beans are grown, the methods of washing and drying beans, the activity of roasting beans, all the way down to brewing methods and all of the different variables that make a delicious cup of joe.

                <p id="testText">Reading</p>
                <p>
                    At the tail end of 2024, Kyra had finally given in to her partner's guile and started reading again. From mid-October to the end of the year, she had read a total of 9 books. In 2025 she aims to read a total of 50 books. Often she'll read fantasy novels, like the Mistborn Trilogy by Brandon Sanderson. 
                    However, she has taken a liking to non-fiction books. Her big recommendation for 2024 is "How to Keep House While Drowning." by K.C Davis, with "The World Atlas of Coffee" by James Hoffman as a very very close second.

                <p>
                    Kyra is a big advocate and supporter of Mental Health services. As a life-long struggler of depression and anxiety, she advocates for people to take better care of their mind, 
                    so that they can in turn take care of their bodies, and their environments and the communities they live in. In March of 2023 she had taken a course and was certified in Mental Health First Aid.
                    Please check out our "Mental Health Resources" page if you are struggling.

                <p>
                    Crocheting has been one of Kyra's passions since she picked it up in 2020. She has completed many projects which you can see over in the crafts gallery page, and there are entries in the blog about it.
                    She has since learned how to knit and embroider. Her next big step in the fiber arts is to learn how to sew.
